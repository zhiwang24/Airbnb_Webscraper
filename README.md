# Airbnb_Webscraper
The project is a web scraping script designed to gather Airbnb listing data for a specific location and period utilizing web scraping techniques. It prompts for user input or uses predefined values for location and date range. 

It then scrapes Airbnb listings for each month within the specified timeframe, extracting property details such as name, beds, date, and price. The collected data is formatted and exported to CSV and JSON files for further analysis.

Utilized Tableau to visualize trends in Airbnb rental prices over time, seasonality in demand, and fluctuations in
availability to explore how external factors such as holidays, and events impact the rental market
